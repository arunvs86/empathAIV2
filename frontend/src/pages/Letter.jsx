    `Dear Grandma,

I think of you every day and miss your warm smile and comforting hugs. Though you're no longer here in person, I feel your presence in the little thingsâ€” the scent of fresh flowers, the songs we used to sing together, and the laughter we shared around the dinner table.

Thank you for teaching me kindness, resilience, and how to find joy even in difficult times. Your wisdom guides me through both sunshine and storm.

I hope you're at peace among the clouds, dancing on sunbeams as you watch over all of us.

With all my love,
Your Grandchild`
